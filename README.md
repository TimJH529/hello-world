# hello-world
This is the obligatory "hello world" exercise to commemorate my github membership.

I am a student in the higher education management program at Pitt. I have some experience with Python, Java, and R. I am interested in research methodology, higher education marketing, and student retention. I hope to use this to improve my understanding of data analytics and applied statistics.
